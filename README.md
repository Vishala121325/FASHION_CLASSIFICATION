# ðŸ‘šðŸ§  Fashion Classification using Neural Networks (Keras)
----
Objective:
- The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that classifies fashion items (e.g., shirts, shoes, bags) from images using the Fashion MNIST dataset. This classification supports applications in retail automation, recommendation systems, and inventory management.
----
Key Features (with Libraries Used):
--  Interactive Environment â€“ Google Colab
--  Data Loading & Preprocessing â€“ TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy
--  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Matplotlib, Seaborn
--  Model Building â€“ TensorFlow / Keras (CNN, Dense Layers)
--  Model Training & Validation â€“ TensorFlow / Keras
--  Performance Evaluation â€“ Scikit-learn (accuracy, confusion matrix)
--  Visualization of Predictions â€“ Matplotlib
--  Well-documented Code â€“ Python scripting with markdown in Colab
